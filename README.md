## Channel Vertex Indicator - ReadMe

This code is for the Channel Vertex Indicator, a trading indicator that helps identify potential trading opportunities based on the concept of triangle patterns. This code is provided as a sample and is not the official version developed by Forex Robot Easy Team.

To use this indicator, you will need to include the necessary libraries: `PositionInfo.mqh` and `Trade.mqh`.

### Indicator Parameters

You can customize the indicator by modifying the following parameters:

- `period`: The period used in the calculation of the indicator values. The default value is 14.
- `applied_price`: The price type used in the calculation, such as close price. The default value is `PRICE_CLOSE`.

### Global Variables

The code defines three global variables:

- `vertex`: The calculated vertex value of the indicator.
- `upperLine`: The upper line value of the indicator.
- `lowerLine`: The lower line value of the indicator.

### Initialization

In the `OnInit()` function, the indicator buffers are initialized using the `SetIndexBuffer()` function. The indicator labels and styles are also set using the `SetIndexLabel()` and `SetIndexStyle()` functions respectively. The `SetIndexDrawBegin()` function is used to set the starting point for drawing the indicator.

### Calculation

The `OnCalculate()` function is responsible for calculating the indicator values for each bar. The code iterates through the bars and calculates the vertex, upper line, and lower line values based on the provided period. The calculated values are stored in the respective indicator buffers.

### Trading Functions

The code provides two trading functions:

- `OpenPosition(int type)`: Opens a position of the specified type (SELL or BUY) based on the current indicator values.
- `ClosePosition(int type)`: Closes a position of the specified type (SELL or BUY) based on the current indicator values.

These functions utilize the `PositionInfo` and `Trade` classes from the included libraries to interact with the trading platform.

### Trading Decisions

The `OnTick()` function is responsible for executing trading decisions based on the indicator values. If the vertex value is above the upper line, a SELL position is opened. If the vertex value is below the lower line, a BUY position is opened. If the vertex value crosses below the upper line, a SELL position is closed. If the vertex value crosses above the lower line, a BUY position is closed.
